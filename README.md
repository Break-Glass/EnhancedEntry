**Bindable Properties**

You are able to set the `LeftIcon` which will place an icon to the left inside the entry, icons to be placed inside respective drawable folders and iOS in the resources files, set the `PaddingLeftIcon` for padding space between icon and entry text.

You are able to set the `BorderWidth` of the entry which must be set for respective bindables such as `CornerRadius`, `FocusBorderColor` etc.

You are able to set `FocusBorderColor` when the entry has focus, the `BorderColor` will be set when off focus.

You are able to set `BackgroundColor` of the entry.

You are able to set `LeftPadding`, `RightPadding` and `TopBottomPadding` which will set the desired padding between the entry text and the edge of the entry.

You are able to set the `ReturnKeyType` which will set the text displayed for the keyboard action button. Runtime exception will be thrown if unsupported on platoform.

You are able to set the `NextEntry` which is the entry that will be given focus if when keyboard action button invoked or if `GoToNextEntryOnLengthBehaviour` condition is satisfied.

You are able to set the `KeyBoardAction` which will take some given command parameter to exceute.

**Custom Behaviours** 

You are able to set the `PasswordCompareValidationBehavior` which will compare these entries with some condition checks, each entry should contain the collection `PasswordCompareValidation` of entries to compare (see examples above), you are also able to set the `ValidColor` and `InValidColor` of the entry for the given condition of the password when there is or int a match. PLEASE NOTE: Although these bindable properties are set per entry, they should all have the same values for all entries to check in the collection. You are able to set the `MinimumLength` of the passwords. Currently the password validator requires an uppercase, lowercase and a number, therefore the minimum length can be set.

You are able to set the `EmailValidatorBehavior` for entries that will be used for emails, the `EmailRegularExpression` can be overriden if desired.

You are able to set `GoToNextEntryOnLengthBehaviour` which will set focus to the `NextEntry` on the given `CharacterLength`, use the `MaxLengthValidator` i.e. MaxLength="1" as well to ensure that entry doesnt exceed the `CharacterLength`
